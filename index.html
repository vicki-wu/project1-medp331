          <h2>Triassic Period (251-201 million years ago)</h2>
          <p>
            The Triassic period marked the beginning of the age of dinosaurs.
            Following the Permian-Triassic extinction event, which wiped out
            nearly 95% of marine species and 70% of terrestrial vertebrate
            species, the Earth was ripe for new life forms to emerge.
          </p>
          <p>
            Early dinosaurs evolved alongside other reptiles, and by the end of
            this period, they had become the dominant land animals. The climate
            during this time was generally hot and dry, with much of the land
            concentrated in the supercontinent Pangaea.
          </p>
          <p>Notable dinosaurs from this period include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Coelophysis: One of the earliest known dinosaurs, this small,
              agile predator was about 3 meters long.
            </li>
            <li>
              Plateosaurus: An early example of a prosauropod, it was one of the
              first large plant-eating dinosaurs.
            </li>
            <li>
              Eoraptor: A small, bipedal dinosaur that is considered one of the
              earliest dinosaurs ever discovered.

          <h2>Jurassic Period (201-145 million years ago)</h2>
          <p>
            The Jurassic period saw a significant diversification of dinosaur
            species. The supercontinent Pangaea began to break apart, leading to
            the formation of new ecosystems and the evolution of new dinosaur
            species to fill these niches.
          </p>
          <p>
            This era witnessed the rise of long-necked sauropods, which grew to
            enormous sizes, and the first appearance of birds. The climate was
            generally warmer and more humid than in the Triassic, with lush
            vegetation covering much of the land.
          </p>
          <p>Some iconic dinosaurs from the Jurassic period include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Brachiosaurus: A massive, long-necked herbivore that could reach
              heights of up to 16 meters.
            </li>
            <li>
              Stegosaurus: Known for the distinctive plates along its back and
              spikes on its tail.
            </li>
            <li>
              Allosaurus: A large carnivorous theropod, often considered the
              "lion" of the Jurassic period.
            </li>
            <li>
              Archaeopteryx: Often called the "first bird," this small,
              feathered dinosaur provides a link between non-avian dinosaurs and
              modern birds.

          <h2>Cretaceous Period (145-66 million years ago)</h2>
          <p>
            The Cretaceous period was the last and longest period of the
            dinosaur age. It was a time of continued continental breakup, with
            the Atlantic Ocean widening and South America separating from
            Africa. The climate was generally warm, with high sea levels
            creating numerous shallow inland seas.
          </p>
          <p>
            This period saw the evolution of some of the most famous dinosaur
            species, as well as the diversification of flowering plants, which
            became the dominant form of vegetation by the end of the era.
          </p>
          <p>Notable dinosaurs from the Cretaceous include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Tyrannosaurus Rex: Perhaps the most famous dinosaur, this apex
              predator could grow up to 12 meters long.
            </li>
            <li>
              Triceratops: A large herbivore known for its distinctive frill and
              three facial horns.
            </li>
            <li>
              Velociraptor: A small, agile predator made famous by the "Jurassic
              Park" franchise, though in reality, it was much smaller than
              depicted in the films.
            </li>
            <li>
              Ankylosaurus: A heavily armored herbivore with a club-like tail
              used for defense.
            </li>
            <li>
              Spinosaurus: The largest known carnivorous dinosaur, with a
              distinctive sail-like structure on its back.
            </li>

          <h2>Mass Extinction (66 million years ago)</h2>
          <p>
            The age of dinosaurs came to an abrupt end about 66 million years
            ago with a mass extinction event known as the Cretaceous-Paleogene
            (K-Pg) extinction. This event wiped out approximately 75% of plant
            and animal species on Earth, including most dinosaurs.
          </p>
          <p>
            The leading theory for this extinction is the impact of a massive
            asteroid or comet, which struck the Earth near the present-day
            Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico. This impact would have caused:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Global climate change, including a prolonged period of cooling
            </li>
            <li>Massive tsunamis and widespread fires</li>
            <li>
              A dust cloud that blocked sunlight, inhibiting photosynthesis
            </li>
            <li>Acid rain from vaporized rock</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            While this event marked the end of most dinosaur species, it paved
            the way for the rise and diversification of mammals, eventually
            leading to the evolution of humans millions of years later. It's
            worth noting that not all dinosaurs went extinct ‚Äì the lineage of
            theropod dinosaurs that includes modern birds survived and continued
            to evolve.
