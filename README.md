# 🦕 Dinosaur Discovery Zone

## 🌟 Project Overview
Dinosaur Discovery Zone is an interactive web experience that takes users on a journey through the fascinating world of dinosaurs. The project aims to educate and entertain visitors with engaging content about different dinosaur eras, fun facts, and a quiz to test their knowledge. 

The webpage tells the story of dinosaurs from the Triassic period to their extinction, using a combination of informative text, images, and interactive elements to create an immersive learning experience.

The design process began with creating the home page. I first laid out all the components I wanted to have on my home page, such as
- The layout of the images, text, and timeline
- Icons representing other pages (fun facts/quiz) & audio I wanted to implement
- Animations to make the page more interactive, such as the fade in animation and hover effects
- A color scheme inspired by natural earth tones to complement the prehistoric theme

I then drafted out how I wanted to format my fun facts and quiz page, which included the same header as the home page and an image alongside the content I wanted to implement. 

## ✨ Features
- 🎬 **Animations**: 
  - Smooth scrolling effect when navigating between eras
  - Hover effects on interactive elements
  - Fade-in animations for content as users scroll
- 🔊 **Sound Effects**: 
  - Background music that can be toggled on/off
- 🖱️ **User-triggered Events**: 
  - Clicking on era points in the timeline to view specific information
  - Answering quiz questions and receiving immediate feedback
  - Toggling background music on/off
- 📱 **Responsive Design**: On phones and tablets, things are adjusted for a better user experience, such as
  -  Icons are adjusted to the top for easier navigation
  -  Display is changed to column so text is more legible and images are better formatted
